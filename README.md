Hello world! My name's Ian - welcome to my Github profile!

I'm a mechanical engineer with a coding hobby (/problem). I like to dabble in all sorts of technologies and plan to post some of my adventures here for posterity. I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn about Linux tools and git - I'm writing this in vim via the Linux Subsystem for Windows. 

If you've arrived here from my LinkedIn page, welcome! Otherwise, here's my LinkedIn page: https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/ianjmckenzie

Stay tuned for future projects that I'll post as inspiration strikes (which may be somewhat infrequently, but we'll see).

-Nai
